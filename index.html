'data-' are HTML5 API attributes that allow JavaScript code to get the specified attributes easily. 'collapse' is mentioned in bootstrap.js. The 'aria-expanded='false' is for screen readers. It means that the expandable section or items is/are currently collapsed (invisible). If set to 'true', it means that the element is explanded (visible). #collapsable-nav is going to be used to specify the contents of the dropdown. The 'id' is only referenced with #, it's defined without it. -->
